#### List OUs in AD where normal users have GP-Link rights. Output will have the SIDs listed which need to be resolved to names in a 2nd step     
```
Get-DomainOU | Get-ObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? { $_.ObjectAceType -eq "GP-Link" -and $_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match "WriteProperty" } | select ObjectDN, SecurityIdentifier | fl
```

You can afterwards convert the SIDs to names like so:
