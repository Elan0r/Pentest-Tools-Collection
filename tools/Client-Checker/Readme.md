# Overview  
This is my PowerShell script to automate client pentest / checkups - at least to a certain extend.  
You can use it together with my PwnDoc vulns to further get rid of unneccessary work -> https://github.com/LuemmelSec/PwnDoc-Vulns  

# What does it do  
You should run it as admin, as certain stuff can only be queries with elevated rights.  
It is used to check a client for common misconfigurations. The list currently includes:  
  - Default Domain Password Policy
  - LSA Protection Settings
  - WDAC Usage
  - AppLocker Usage
  - Credential Guard Settings
  - DMA Protection Settings
  - BitLocker Settings
  - Secure Boot Settings
  - System PATH ACL checks
  - WSUS Settings
  - PowerShell Settings
  - IPv6 Settings
  - NetBIOS / LLMNR Settings
  - SMB Server Settings
  - Firewall Settings
  - AV Settings
  - Proxy Settings
  - Windows Updates
  - 3rd Party Installations
  - RDP Settings
  - WinRM Settings
